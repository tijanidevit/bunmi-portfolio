My stay in The Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro has been challenging, reason being that, when I came to FPI for post utme screening, I overheard most of the students discussing how tough and strict the institution is concerning academics and morals, so since then, I have decided to take my academic serious. 

When I was given admission, and of course  as a reasult of fear of failure, I proposed a reading time ttablefor myself for studying, and then I made friends with those that are more intelligent than I am.
To study is never easy, this is a challenge on it's own. There are times when the body wants to relax even when you are supposed to study. We just shouldn't give it a chance.

I try training my system how to adapt with those periods, I mean periods to socialize and study . It's quite challenging.
Dealing with personal issues plus studying is also a challenge. I just try to forget about anything bothering me whenever I want to study so that I can assimilate easily.

I scheduled myself. I have a particular time for studying. And there's leisure time too. So during the period of studying, I focus mainly on studying and when it also comes to the leisure time I make sure I have fun to the fullest, as all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.
In conclusion, FPI is a wonderful  institution to be, if study periods are not mixed with fun periods.
